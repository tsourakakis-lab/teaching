# Algorithmic techniques for modeling and mining large graphs (AMAzING) 
## KDD 2013, ECML-PKDD 2013 

## Abstract
Network science has emerged over the last years as an interdisciplinary area spanning traditional domains including mathematics, computer science, sociology, biology and economics. Since complexity in social, biological and economical systems, and more generally in complex systems, arises through pairwise interactions there exists a surging interest in understanding networks.

In this tutorial, we will provide an in-depth presentation of the most popular random-graph models used for modeling real-world networks. We will then discuss efficient algorithmic techniques for mining large graphs, with an emphasis on the problems of extracting graph sparsifiers, partitioning graphs into densely connected components, and finding dense subgraphs. We will motivate the problems, we will discuss algorithms to solve them and we will present real-world applications.

Our aim is to survey important results in the areas of modeling and mining large graphs, to uncover the intuition behind the key ideas, and to present future research directions.

## Who Should Attend
The tutorial presents both classic and cutting-edge research topics on networks. We aim to go into depth for the following topics: random graphs, graph sparsifiers, graph partitioning, finding dense subgraphs and their applications. The tutorial will combine a blend of computer science rigor and real-world applications. It should be of theoretical and practical interest to the graph analysis community and a large part of the data mining community as well.

## Prerequisites
Computer science background (B.Sc or equivalent); familiarity with undergraduate level concepts covered in probability and algorithm classes.
