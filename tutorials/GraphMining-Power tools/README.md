### Instructors 

* Christos Faloutsos is a Professor at Carnegie Mellon University. He has received the Presidential Young Investigator Award by the National Science Foundation (1989), the Research Contributions Award in ICDM 2006, twelve ``best paper'' awards, and several teaching awards. He has served as a member of the executive committee of SIGKDD;
he has published over 160 refereed articles, 11 book chapters and one monograph. He holds five patents and he has given over 20 tutorials and 10 invited distinguished lectures. His research interests include data mining for streams and graphs, fractals, database performance, and indexing for multimedia and bio-informatics data. 

* Prof. Gary L. Miller is most famous for his work in algorithm design. He has designed both sequential and parallel algorithms. These new algorithms have appeared in over eighty papers in journals and prestigious conferences. His most recent interest is parallel algorithm design for problems arising from Scientific Computation including parallel algorithms for: partitioners for finite element meshes, parallel preconditioners for iterative linear system solvers, and parallel and sequential algorithms for mesh generation. Computer simulations for highly deformable soft tissues such as individual red blood cells He has been a program committee member on eleven computer science conferences including: the Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science in 1982 1983, 1986, 1990, and 1992, the 1988 VLSI Algorithms and Architectures, the Annual ACM Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures in 1988, 1993(chair), and 2006 and the Annual ACM Symposium on the Theory of Computation 1996(chair) and 2002. He was the general chair for the annual ACM Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures conference. He is an ACM Fellow (2002), and he is a co-recipient of the ACM Paris Kanellakis Theory and Practice Award in 2003.

* Charalampos Tsourakakis is a Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University supported by a NSF fellowship. He holds a Diploma in Electrical and Diploma Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens. His research interests include spectral graph theory and data mining.
